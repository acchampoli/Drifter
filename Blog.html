          <p>
            <div id="indent">She sat across from me, eyes fixed on mine. The curtains drawn to help me relax. A roommate once told me lowlight is the best light for the brain. After briefing my mother, she hands me a device. A nodule in each hand
              connected to long wires trailing back to the machine laying in her lap. She instructs me to close my eyes and focus on the buzzing of the nodules. Switching back and forth in my clammy palms.</div>

            <div id="normalText">“You’re on a train now. Take a seat and look out the window. What do you see?”
              <br></div>
            <br><em>
              <center>I see mountains flash by.</center>
            </em>
            <br><br>
            <div id="normalText"> “Think of a time you felt most at peace. A place where you would go to feel content again.” A haunting voice instructs me.
              <br><br></div>
            <div id="indent">Suddenly the train stops and I’m at Sandyneck Beach. No one is there but me. Wind whipping my hair, slapping my cheeks, sticking to my lips. My feet are buried and cold in the sand. I step forward and everything moves
              faster than normal. Like when you’ve missed sleep for days and your sugar is low, and the world feels like it’s moving at an abnormal pace. Before I know it, I’ve climbed the jetty. The second one to the left, the biggest with the most
              man-made caves inside. Another flash goes by and I’m at the end of it. The sky is dark but it’s not night. Clouds try to suffocate the light leaving everything in a cool shade of blue. I sit on furthest boulder that is breaking the
              crashing waves. The ocean angrily thrashing towards me, and I feel no fear at all. Strange considering my deepest fear is the ocean: it’s depth, power and mystery. But I am calm. I feel safe for just a moment. I don’t worry about
              anyone coming to find me, or the ocean swallowing me whole without a single witness. There’s no sound but the wind and the waves, and it smells like salt and my first pet dog. There’s a presence here, a protective one. He’s here, not
              watching from afar or in any particular place. He’s just there with me. Before I know it, I’m ripped away by the therapist’s voice.</div>
            <br>
            <div id="normalText"> “Okay, are you there now?”
              <br>“Yes.”
              <br>“Alright, when you’re ready let’s begin by talking about what happened to your father.”
