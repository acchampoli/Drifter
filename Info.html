 <div class="textWrap1">    <img id="selfie" src="http://i66.tinypic.com/aky1rl.jpg">
          <p>Born and raised all over the Northeast with a real drive to travel, meet new people and work on big projects. For the past seven years I have settled in to Boston, MA while looking for a new and gratifying career in photography and
            production. I'm interested in street fashion, modernism, mysteries, hip-hop, global culture, restoring old photos, retouching digital images, organizing projects, painting and writing. I am experienced and skilled in Adobe Photoshop,
            InDesign, Lightroom, Capture One and scanning systems. In whatever job setting I am in, I always work diligently to move upwards by taking on new roles and responsibilities. I appreciate a fun and fast paced environment and thrive on
            pressure to work effectively and efficiently. In the past I have managed a gallery and photo labs, been a technical assistant in a darkroom and computer lab in a photo department, photographed weddings and portraits as an assistant
            photographer, done post-production work for photographers and other artists, crafted cocktails as a bartender, volunteered as a ESL teacher, designed signs, created social media content and managed websites. I am also comfortable writing
            correspondence letters to clients, designing invoices, keeping detailed records of sales and data, and producing manuals and new systems for streamlined organization.</p></div>
         <div class="textWrap2"><p>In my personal life I gravitate towards live music, illustration, web design, mystery, thrillers, puzzles, discussing strategy
            social phenomena, taboos, discovering information about different cultures and new technologies. If you are interested in my work or my services please feel welcome to contact me at <a href="mailto:acchampoli@gmail.com" id="emailOnInfo"> acchampoli@gmail.com!</a>
